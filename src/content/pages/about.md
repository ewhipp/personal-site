I am a software engineer who has worked in multiple roles from database administration, IT infrastructure, devops (Kubernetes, Docker, Spinnaker, Jenkins, Sonarqube), and software engineering.

I am interested in solving hard problems through technology. This happens through leadership at all levels. It is not about being the best leader, it is about fostering a team that is interested in ideas and execution of those ideas that will make their project more resilient, reliable, and testable.

In my experience as a software engineer, I have led teams that follow extreme programming and test-driven development ideologies and others. I am absolutely an advocate for TDD and DDD in most instances and do my best to mentor and foster this kind of ideology. Without a tested application, how can we know if our application is doing what we expect it to everytime we deploy?

I am currently in Washington DC working for ICANN and am looking for remote work.
