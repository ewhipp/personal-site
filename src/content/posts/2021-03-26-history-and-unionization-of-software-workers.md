  thoughts surrounding the topic for a contemporary audience.

### Problem Statement

Software Engineers like many other professions are placed in a position such that, given employer requirements, must work overtime, have been placed in situations where larger corporations can bid down salaries and are expected to be on call for most positions. Furthermore, the young software engineer is generally expected to work overtime to compensate for a lack of experience. Although the compensation of the average software engineer [exceeds the standard wage rate of most workers](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm) in the US, the question remains: should software engineers unionize?

### The History of Unionization in Software

The sentiment within the software industry leaders and onlookers has always been: what is the need for unionization? Software jobs are high paying, they boast free lunches, gyms, and perks most sectors would never offer their employees. This is rooted in the ideology of [one of the founders of modern technology](https://books.google.com/books/about/Silicon_Valley_Fever.html?id=frYrAAAAYAAJ): [Robert Noyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce). The mantra for anti-union sentiment has always been that unionization will stagger growth, generate bureaucracy in the workplace, and stagger the invisible hand of innovation. Once Noyce came out with the sentiment, all leaders of the software followed in his footsteps.

The use of contractors, providing stock options over benefits, and [the illusion of unlimited time off](https://www.workforce.com/news/unlimited-paid-time-off-is-a-deceptive-ploy-in-todays-workplace) has been the requirement for growth in the industry since before the dot com boom. We continue to see the effects of this type of thinking during [the Coronavirus pandemic](https://www.thedailybeast.com/over-400-bird-employees-were-laid-off-in-two-minute-zoom-webinar-report).

In a nutshell, from the 80s until the late 2000s, there were very minimal attempts to unionize. The only exception being workers within the telecommunications sector. The entirety of the [tech sector has less than 2% unionization rates](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm) (for more info CTRL + F: Professional and technical services. However, a shift in sentiment towards the workspace has brought with it some prospects for an effort to change the status quo.

### The Why

Most examples of unionization or needs for a union tend to arise from worker conditions, improvement of wages, bargaining for benefits, pensions. However, an often-overlooked reason for unionization is for the ability to have a say in the workplace regarding:

1. What service or product you produce
2. How to produce that product or service
3. Where to sell that product or service

This appears to be [one](https://www.wired.com/story/how-kickstarter-employees-formed-union/) of the [many](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2021/01/21/layoffs-union-angered-instacart-eliminates-nearly-2-000-jobs/6663796002/) [driving](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954710407/at-google-hundreds-of-workers-formed-a-labor-union-why-to-protect-ourselves) [factors](https://www.thedailybeast.com/over-400-bird-employees-were-laid-off-in-two-minute-zoom-webinar-report) behind current desires to unionize within the software industry. The issue isn't necessarily the pay or the inability to live based on the average wages - the issue appears to be based on the innate desire for workers to have a say in their workplace.

### Democracy in the Workplace

I live in the United States, and like to think that as a society, we believe in the values of democracy. I am not a complete advocate or completely against the idea of unionization at the workplace, however, the nonchalant methods that some companies use to show their distaste for unions lead me to beg the question: why are companies [so hostile to the voice of their employees](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242676/instacart-firing-every-union-employee-coronavirus-pandemic)?

It is interesting to me that we shun other countries for their apparent lack of freedom and democracy, yet for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week - we rid ourselves of an environment that caters to democracy and freedom. What unions supposedly offer us is a collectively determined vote regarding what our company does, with whom the company will do business, and how it will conduct business internally. While the notion of wage is not particularly a hot topic for software workers, there is another argument for how [unions encourage wage growth](https://www.epi.org/publication/union-decline-lowers-wages-of-nonunion-workers-the-overlooked-reason-why-wages-are-stuck-and-inequality-is-growing/).

### Unions are for Workers Who have no Variance

### A Counter to Concentrated Power

The argument I'm posing through this historical lens is that balance is an important part of any ecosystem. Where there is fire, we balance it with water, where there is brightness, there is darkness. When we look at the landscape of the business world today, we can see a highly concentrated amount of power in the technical institutions. The problem with this accumulated power is that it allows a small group of people to decide the appropriation of said power where they deem it critical. However, we have seen in many instances [how central planning can cause inefficiencies](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021716/why-ussr-collapsed-economically.asp) and singular interests to be executed upon.

The idea that software engineers shouldn't unionize because they have good pay is a scapegoat for allowing white-collar workers to believe [they have stability](https://www.protocol.com/coronavirus-tech-startups-layoffs-cuts) and a say in their workplace. The argument for a union [is the argument for a voice within the workplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Workers_Union).

In the end, the union is a separate pillar that can be used to balance the power that capital accumulation and hierarchical structures bring to a workplace. That pillar can be corrupted, however, is it better to have the opportunity of a pillar to voice your opinions, worries, and thoughts regarding what you produce, how you produce it, and for whom you produce it?

### Summary

I started thinking about this due to the [unionization effort by Amazon workers in Bessemer Alabama](https://newrepublic.com/article/161821/amazon-union-vote-results-bessemer-alabama). Furthermore, I have friends in the gaming industry, and [I see similar characteristics](https://www.wired.com/story/first-video-game-workers-unions/?code=7Q9hT9fi-pKqao19_x4VEVWFupQ5puh14ExPjaR1Zpe&state=%7B%22redirectURL%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Ffirst-video-game-workers-unions%2F%3Futm_source%3DWIR_REG_GATE%22%7D&utm_source=WIR_REG_GATE) in that industry as well. The question then came to me, what is the driving force behind unionization? What is the importance of unionization? Why don't we have unions within the software industry?

The outcome of those three questions was:

1. A voice in the workplace that can provide benefits that allow you to work decently and live a life you are proud of.
2. A voice in the workplace to give you the opportunity and in some cases, requirement, to be heard
3. There has been an ongoing campaign by the employer to provide enough comfort to extinguish the thought from our minds

My philosophy is that the workplace should be as democratic as we can allow it to be. Increase efficiencies, not necessarily profit, but the output of labor per worker. To maximize the utility of all workers, some concessions must be made between the employee and the employer. That being said, unions are not always 100% correct - but neither are employers. The ideal is to have a system that allows us as software engineers to collectively voice our opinion regarding what we do, how we do it, who we sell it to, and the conditions of which we are in during this process. When I thank my team for their effort on initiatives, I mean it, and that is why I ask them every week (collectively and individually): what can I do to make them more effective? Comfortable? Enjoy their work more? Do they want to work on a different type of service? Do they want to explore new languages? I don't ask these things because that's what leadership books tell me to do, I ask them because [cooperation is more effective](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1995/01/1995_bpeamicro_craig.pdf) than authority.
