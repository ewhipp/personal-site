  Freedom in personal computing is important.

I recently updated an old Thinkpad T400 of mine to use [Libreboot](https://libreboot.org/) along with a couple of hardware enhancements. I've been using this computer as my daily driver for tasks like personal projects, coding, surfing the web - pretty much anything that doesn't require extensive graphics usage.

As the days have gone on, I've come to realize that most of the day to day tasks that users are experiencing do not require more than an SSD and 8GB of RAM. Over the past few days, I have had to get used to some loading time, but nothing that has dramatically changed my level of productivity. This all being said, I've decided that I'm going to do my best to stick with the librebooted Thinkpad as my daily driver because I've come to understand that freedom is worth the extra pains.

This isn't a really planned out blog post, more a stream of consciousness. However, I was thinking back to when I was in high school and reading [Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden). At the time, I saw no value for that book. However, as I grow older - I've continued to understand that discipline and self-reliance play a key role in being able to survive & thrive in the current state of affairs. This brings me to the importance of computing freedom.

Edward Snowden has been at the forefront of the security conversation since the early 2010s and I remember him stating something along the following lines:

> Even if you have nothing to hide, someone can find something you're hiding.

I remember reading that and laughing it off. However, as time continues, things become more scarce, etc. It might be worth exercising those muscles. Now, I don't want to be an alarmist or say that I'm never going to use a cloud device again - but I think taking the moment to think: `Does this action give me more or less freedom?` more often, might help us in the long run.
