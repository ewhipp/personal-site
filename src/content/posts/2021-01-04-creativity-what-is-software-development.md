My origins as a software engineer are not abnormal however, when I tell some people how I got into the field they are surprised. When I was younger, I was determined to work in the music or audio industry. Whether that was as a musician, an audio engineer, mixer, live performance, etc. I was determined that I’d be doing something creative. This all changed when I went to college for audio engineering and technology.



For the first 3 years of my college endeavors, I had done a lot of work with economics, business, and audio engineering. I had initially gone to school for economics with a music minor and changed to audio engineering and audio technology and ultimately got a double major in computer science and audio technology. This would appear to be an inconsistent track however, each topic is deeply rooted in creativity.

As previously mentioned, the ultimate goal was to do something in music or audio - this came from the desire to do something creative with my life. I’ve always struggled with the desire to be creative while also commanding a skill-set that is valuable to a market-driven society. However, the struggle ultimately changed when I took an audio programming class. We did multiple things in the class:

1. Created a Polymorphic Synthesizer
2. Created a vocoder
3. Created a program that would input any audio and allow you to do things like compress/filter/echo
4. A capstone based on all that we had learned

While going through this class I came to realize that one of the most creative and helpful things that could be done in the modern economy would be to learn how to program. Not only does this allow the programmer to solve their problems through creativity, but they could also use their abilities to help make other people’s lives better. Whether that be through life-changing applications or something that allows you to work 5 minutes faster.

The paradigm shift happened very viscerally for me during that class. I no longer had this overwhelming feeling that to survive and thrive in the modern workplace, you’d have to sell out. Instead, I got the feeling that the more time one dedicated to learning this craft, the more helpful one would be to their constituents.

Regardless, I thought it would be beneficial for me to get these thoughts onto paper. Software engineers always have moments where they aren’t 150% dedicated to their work, but what always reminds me and helps me get into the flow or creative mindset is the fact that my job is to be creative to solve problems for one or many other people.

The best part about that previous sentence, there is nothing dictated in there. Software development doesn’t have to do with Java, C, C++, Node, Golang, Elixir, no - those are components of application development and creating products. However, software development is creativity. It is the ability to ask yourself and your team, what do the users need? How can we create an experience for that to be completed with minimal friction? At the core of the profession, a software engineer brings ideas to life, investigates solutions, and helps others.
