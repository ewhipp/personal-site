### Problem Statement

You are faced with a problem to solve. What are the requirements? What features are going to be required as a part of acceptance? How will you or the QA team test this in the end? These questions can and should be answered beforehand. However, the actionable part of this process is the next question: How are you going to implement this feature and what is the best way to do it? The answer to this question - which should be intentionally answered before every feature, is always: It depends.

### Shirking Responsibility

The previous sentence would appear to most as a shirking of responsibility. However, the consistent theme I've noticed as a part of my software development career is that [over-determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermination) is rampant is software engineering whether it be the answer to what makes a good user experience? What is the cause of this bug? The list goes on. The problem with answering this question is that we can never really know the answer - we can only know the answer that is determined by the amount of information we have available to us at the time of discovery. That being said, by the time we make a decision, the parameters for which that decision is made are likely to have already changed.

### An Adequate Option

Every software engineer should look to create the `best` option available at a given time, however, the more important goal should be the continuous implementation of adequate options. This will ultimately lead to the balance between perfect and good - allowing you to implement the solution necessary for your customer, while completing it an efficient enough amount of time.

A large problem I've witnessed in software is balancing the competing forces of:

* Should we do it?
* Can we do it?

The answer to the latter is generally - yes. The answer to the first question is - surprise, surprise: it depends. How many resources do we have for the project? What have we already planned for in this release? What is the long term goal of the business? Are there any bugs that will provide more value? Do we have adequate resources to maintain a feature of this scope? The parameters for determining the answer to these questions are always growing, and mean different things to different stakeholders.

### A Good Option

All of the above being said, as software engineers, I think the best option we can determine will be a good option. We can aim for adequacy, but if we can generate a good option given all of the parameters described above (and the parameters we have not gone through), we can assume that the project will be good enough for the problem space we are working in. The ultimate question is: Are we working toward something our customers will value?

If the customer is receiving value based on the work you are doing, the next question is: How can we improve the amount of value they receive from our product? I hope by this point you see the contradictions within this area of work: it is impossible to find the most correct answer. The ultimate struggle for all of us: to find the good answer given the information we have at the time.

### Summary

There are two characteristics that I've seen in fundamentally good software engineers: curiosity and humility. If you come into this profession or hobby with the idea that you will always find the best answer or best implementation strategy - you are handicapping yourself. Whenever you are asked an open ended question, the go-to answer should always be: It depends - because it always does.
